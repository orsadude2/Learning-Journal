Learning Journal 9 December 2017

1. I was paired with a fellow student at my level of comprehension and understanding...meaning not much of either. We both made it through 201 but are probably at the bottom of the class.
2. Good thing about this pairing is that I was forced to create solutions for the lab on my own. JB, took a look at what I was doing and instilled confidence. I knew my syntax was wrong, the code wouldn't run, etc....but what I had done was my work, with no outside influence or suggestions. Felt good knowing I can at least do something.
3. Talked to Joshua, a guy I met through Craigslist, who created my 1st mobile app purely in JS, for the 1st time in about 2 months. He's the reason I'm in CodeFellows...or at least suggested I look into it...if I want to see if codingi is a good fit. I know I'm not as passionate as my classmates only because I'm not looking to get a job or alter my lifestyle. I'm only looking to increase revenue!
4. I asked Joshua if he went to any coding bootcamp and he said no! Of course that prompted the question...then why/how is he so good. His answer, nights, weekends, and anything that allowed him to practice and try stuff out.
5. So now I'm on a fence....on one hand, if I don't make it through CF, no big deal...there are ways to get the knowledge I want at a much easier and comfortable pace, suitable to my style of learning. On the other hand...would be awesome to get it done. I'll continue as I can keep up...but not going to lose any sleep on grades or getting through anymore.
6. We'll see later if this approach is a mistake or not.
