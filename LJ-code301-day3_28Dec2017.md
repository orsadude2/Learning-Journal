Learning Journal 28 December 2017

1. Fairly disappointed. Can't even figure out how to accomplsh the simple UI challenge. Its as if nothing from 201 stuck. 
2. Tried to teach myself Flexbox, since we didn't use that in 201. To no avail. 
3. Seem to be slipping farther behind. Understand what I'm doing...but now why and how.
4. Will probably skip 401 and pick it up in the summer/fall. Need to take care of the day job.
5. Have (2) personal website/projects I need to start. One for Eric Cobb and one for the Veterans Administration.
