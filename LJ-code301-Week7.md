#LJ-code301-Week 7

1. Well it's all done but the crying...Code301 is over for me!
2. Scored about a 40% on the entrance exam! Not bad, considering there were about 3 - 4 questions that were questionable. That means I may have gotten a 50% or better...and that is probably where my comprehension level is for all of the subjects thrown at me during 301.
3. Good thing is...I have all the information I need to study and review...and the time to do it without feeling pressured.
4. Question is...if I learn all of this stuff on my own...can I attempt to test into 401? Who knows?
5. The sad thing is...I won't know what I won't be learning that is important to me...in 401.
