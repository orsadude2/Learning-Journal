#LJ-code301-Week 6

1. At this point, I am resigned to the fact that I lost my way during the server/client side exercises.
2. I did not understand the importance of the lessons on GET, POST, CREATE or their value
3. I do understand how Node.js and NPM work...but not really grasping the function and why of handlebars, did me a disservice later on.
4. Still need to understand AJAX and JSON syntax and reasoning behind using or needing to use it
5. POSTGRES and SQL was way too fast. Didn't realize it at the time why we needed it....but need way more practice on just coding in SQL alone, before trying to apply it to coding book author data, etc.
6. Functional Programming....clueless. I understand why you would need to know the "rules" not so sure I know enough about coding and js to be concerned about FP.
7. Due to the comprehension level of all things previous to Production and Deployment...nothing now or after makes or will make sense. Now just going through the motions of trying to keep up or at least understand the theory behind the practice.
